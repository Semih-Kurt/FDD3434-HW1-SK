************************
One can create all the plots in the report by running the script "hw1_codes.m".
The script requires "zoo.data" and "matlab_bgl_all_sp_mex.mexw64" to be present at the same directory.
"zoo.data" is dataset, and "matlab_bgl_all_sp_mex.mexw64" is library for shortest path on graph algorithm.
All the helper functions are added at the bottom of the script.
One should run the following sections of "hw1_codes.m" in sequential order to get all the plots:
DATASET PRE-PROCESS
PCA
MDS
MODIFIED MDS
ISOMAP

For report,some plots are generated more than once for different parameters, 
one also can change the corresponding parameter to re-create these plots.
